## Before You Start

Download the client for your operating system [here](/signet/downloads/) before starting.

## Initializing your device for the first time 

1. Plug in your device and start the client
1. Click "Initialize the device for the first time"
1. Choose a master password. Ideally it should be randomized, longer than eight characters and not a password you have used
anywhere else. If you create a new password for Signet it may be a good idea to write down the password for a short time until you have it memorized.
1. Press initialize and wait for the initialization process to complete. Initialization will zero out the device's memory and use random data generated both on the device and the host to setup authentication and encryption keys.

## Unlocking your device

1. Enter your master password and press "Unlock"
1. If this is the first time you have unlocked your device on the computer you are using you will be prompted to configure the client
1. Click to configure the client if you use a keyboard layout other than English(US) or want to enable automatic backups on the system
you are running the client from

## Adding data to your device

Once you have unlocked your device you are ready to add data to it. To add new data to Signet click the add button which is near the top
of the window and has a plus sign icon. You can select which kind of data to add with the data type pulldown menu below add button. When you press the add button an entry creation dialog will appear. There will required fields associated with the entries data type but you can also add your own fields by entering them at the bottom of the dialog. To add a new field first set it's name and data type then press the add button. Then the new fields value can be set. When you are done setting all of the values click create and press Signet's button to confirm
the creation.

You may also create new types of data by selecting "Data type" in the data types pull down menu. The fields you add to entries created in this mode are the required fields of a new data type.

## Accessing your data

The "data type" pulldown near the top of the window selects which kind of entries are visible in the window. To perform an action on data
you have created either right click on the entry in the view or press one of the toolbar buttons at the bottom of the window. The available actions are different depending
on what kind of data is selected but all data types have a button to:

- Open the entry to view or edit it
- Delete the entry
- Launch a browser and open a URL associated with the entry (if available)

For account entries there are also buttons to login to the account (type username then password), type the username, type the password. Note that typing operations will cause Signet to become backgrounded to
make it easy to select a destination text box for the data. When you have selected where you need the data typed press the device button. When you need to access the client again just press the deviec button again and it will come back to the foreground.
