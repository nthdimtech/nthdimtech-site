Welcome to the website of Nth Dimension, creators of [Signet](/signet/) and [Signet HC](/signet-hc/)

Signet is a portable open-source software USB device that encrypts and stores
your passwords and other important data.  Signet was funded on
[Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/nth-dimension/signet).
Crowd supply is is currently accepting
[orders](https://www.crowdsupply.com/nth-dimension/signet)
of Signet now.

We have created a more advanced Signet device called
[Signet High-Capacity](https://www.crowdsupply.com/nth-dimension/signet-high-capacity).
In addition to the features offered by Signet, Signet High-Capacity features a
high-speed USB interface, 32GB of encrypted mass storage, FIDO2 two-factor
authentication support, and cryptographic features. Visit the
